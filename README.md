Spotify_E2E_ETL_DataEngineering_project -
Project focuses on constructing a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline utilizing the Spotify API within the AWS environment. The pipeline seamlessly extracts data from the Spotify API, undergoes transformation processes to achieve the desired format, and efficiently loads it into a designated AWS data store. This initiative harmonizes the power of Spotify's API with the scalability and reliability of AWS, showcasing our commitment to streamlined data processing and storage.
